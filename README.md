# Nashville-Housing-Data-for-Data-Cleaning
To clean data, everyone has some kind of checklist.
This is my data-cleaning checklist.
Are values prone to error?
Do we have the same unit for the data?
Is there consistency in the meaning of data?
Are there missing values in your data and what is the reason and what you can do about it?
Is the same value recorded in the same way everywhere?
Are there any duplicates?
