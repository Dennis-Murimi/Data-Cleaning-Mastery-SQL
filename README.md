# Nashville-Housing-Data-for-Data-Cleaning
To clean data, everyone has some kind of checklist.
This is my data-cleaning checklist.
Are values prone to error?
Do we have the same unit for the data?
Is there consistency in the meaning of data?
Are there missing values in your data and what is the reason and what you can do about it?
Is the same value recorded in the same way everywhere?
Are there any duplicates?
Is your data unbiased?
Removed all sources of noise from your data?
Identified and remove sources of data leakage?
Are there any obvious outliers?
I used SQL language (Structured Query Language).

These are commands that I added to my queries.
CLEANING DATA IN SQL QUERIES.
STANDARDIZE DATE FORMAT.
POPULATE PROPERTY ADDRESS DATA.
BREAKING OUT ADDRESSES INTO INDIVIDUAL COLUMNS (ADDRESS, CITY, STATE).
CHANGE Y AND N TO YES AND NO IN THE "SOLD AS VACANT" FIELD.
REMOVE DUPLICATES.
ORDER BY PropertyAddress.
DELETE UNUSED COLUMNS.
